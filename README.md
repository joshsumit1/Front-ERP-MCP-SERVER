# üåê FrontAccounting MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

This project is an **MCP Server + Client** system that connects the **FrontAccounting ERP** (a financial management ERP system) to advanced AI agents using the **Model Context Protocol**.

It allows natural language interaction with ERP functions (e.g. view invoices, list customers, create items) using tools exposed via the MCP Server and callable by LLMs such as **Gemini** via the MCP Client.
